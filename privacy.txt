1. Some discord messages from servers the bot is in may be collected for catching server raides, checking against tos, and searching for in-game cheating. These messages are stored locally and only I will see them, except in the event of clear cheats, in which case the appropriate messages will be shared with sb admins and other related parties. Users may opt-out of message caching by direct request, and may request cached messages for their server at any time.
2. Any sb mods that are entered to be run through the custom command will be stored for future use and checking for server abuse.
3. Server images may be stored for use by ranked duel backgrounds.
4. No gathered messages will be sold, or shared outside of sb related discord servers
