To use this bot, you must fulfill the following requirements:
1. You must have a valid ECP when using the bot to host games. This bot is
not to allow players without an ECP to access functions that they would
have to pay for. (as per rule two here:
https://github.com/bhpsngum/starblast-modding)
2. At least one admin member of the server must be in my testing server to
more easily communicate changes and bans.
3. I must be in the server the bot is in for debugging and anti-spam
purposes.
Using the bot without fulfilling these requirements may result in a user or
server hosting blacklist.
You or your server may also be put on the blacklist for:
1. Excessive in game cheating
2. Repeated complaints of toxic gameplay (i.e. interrupting duels)
3. Using commands the connect to the starblast server in some way in
quick succession (i.e. running /newsb in multiple servers at the same
time, repeatedly calling /status)
4. Use or creation of any other exploits to circumvent previous rules or the
blacklist
